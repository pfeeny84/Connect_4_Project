# Connect_4_Project

Connect Four is a two-player game where the players take turns dropping colored tokens from the top into a seven-column, six-row  grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four tokens in a row of their respective colour.
